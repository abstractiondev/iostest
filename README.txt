Abstraction Test/Demonstration for iOS
--------------------------------------

This project serves for testing, evaluating and demonstrating the abstraction capabilities for iOS development.

The evaluation portion is particularly important, because iOS is the first platform to target, that will be using separate IDEs for platform build and to maintain abstractions.

The iOS platform build is done with Xcode 4
The abstraction is managed with MonoDevelop

Both running side by side in OSX, and using Git/GitHub as repository distributing.
